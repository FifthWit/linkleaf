# LinkLeaf

LinkLeaf is a link in bio / linktree alternative, I designed it with React, React-Router, Tailwind, and Radix-UI.

The system is based on just having URL params with JSON, that way I dont have to deal with garbage like accounts.

## Testing URL Currently

```http://localhost:5173/link?json={%22name%22:%20%22FifthWit%22,%22badges%22:%20[{%22name%22:%20%22GitHub%22,%22link%22:%20%22https://github.com/FifthWit%22,%22image%22:%20%22https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/25/25231.png%22},{%22name%22:%20%22P-Stream%22,%22link%22:%20%22https://pstream.mov%22,%22image%22:%20%22https://pstream.mov/favicon-32x32.png?v=2%22},{%22name%22:%20%22FMHY%22,%22link%22:%20%22https://fmhy.net%22,%22image%22:%20%22https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_s67a0/styles/communityIcon_9yusohfurqse1.png%22}]}```
